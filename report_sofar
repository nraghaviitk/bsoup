requests is not getting the whole page. which is renedered by js
so tried selenium, selenium also seem to give the same output

needed selenium browser drivers, tried chrome, ended up with firefox.
selenium with driver execute script with scroll down and wait to render and load into soup worked.

and soup searching is not straightforward but not tough either

Lastly, the scraping depends on loading of the page as the driver needs to scroll down, so it depends on the internet connection at the time. if it is a slow connection need to sleep more between scrolls.

just a change test for git
